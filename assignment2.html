            I started the assignment in Illustrator with a pentagon. I cut out skinny rectangles in each side.
            Per advice from Nadya that it would go together better if you make the beginning of the slots angled I made angles using triangles.
            I ended up forgetting my caliper so I just guestimated the widths of the slots.
            I did 2 trials with slots that were slightly too skinny and deep.

            <p>
            My final version the slots ended up being 0.11 inches wide and 0.657 inches long.
            I also decided that because I had a lot of cardboard I would just cut out as many shapes as I could.

            To cut I used Joshua's recommended settings of 25 speed and 100 power and it worked perfectly for me.
            The first time I forgot to set the size of the document to larger than 8.5x11, but figured it out and changed the settings right away.

              Overall, I was able to follow advice from Joshua and Nadya and make my kit easily without huge problems.
              I also discovered that laser cut carboard smells pretty bad.
