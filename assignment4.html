            I started this project wanting to make an egg because of easter.
            I looked up a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW9ZjXTSd3s">tutorial to make an egg in rhino</a> and followed it.
            I also drew a chick in rhino because I wanted to incorporate that into my lamp somehow.

              I used grasshopper to extrude parts and make a polar array of my curve.
              I decided to make a container for the light and a top part to hold the pieces together.
              The plan was for the chick to be in the top part and the light would project the chick sillouhette.

            Cardboard was easy to cut out because we have been doing that for the past couple of weeks.
            Settings used: 25 speed, 100 power, 50 frequency.

            Print is still in progress!
