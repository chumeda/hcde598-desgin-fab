              For this assignment I wanted to create a box with a lid mechanism that slides into the box and flaps down.
              In OnShape I started with an extruded square and used thicken to make the solid.
              Then I created another added extrusion for the box butt.
              It took a little while to work out how I was going to construct it but after consulting Joshua I worked out that I would 3D print all the parts.

            <p>
              While 3D printing I had a problem copying my file to the printer and I think the problem was that if you export all of your parts at once then it causes that error.
              I exported all the parts one by one and was able to copy files to the printer.

            <p>
              Joshua gave me advice that I should add a bottom section when printing the small connectors.
              That setting is called raft in the building plate adhesion section.
              These parts printed smoothly and snapping off the part was really satisfying.

            <p>
              There was no gluestick when I started printing my cover so it didn't stick to the bottom and one of the corners lifted during printing.
              Also, the cover printed as hollow and with no top. I'm a little confused, but I will ask Joshua in class what happened.
