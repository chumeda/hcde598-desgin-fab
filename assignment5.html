              For this assignment I wanted to create a box with a lid mechanism that slides into the box and flaps down.
              In OnShape I started with an extruded square and used thicken to make the solid.
              Then I created another added extrusion for the box butt.
              It took a little while to work out how I was going to construct it but after consulting Joshua I worked out that I would 3D print all the parts.

            <p>
              While 3D printing I had a problem copying my file to the printer and I think the problem was that if you export all of your parts at once then it causes that error.
              I exported all the parts one by one and was able to copy files to the printer.

            <p>
              Joshua gave me advice that I should add a bottom section when printing the small connectors.
              That setting is called raft in the building plate adhesion section.
              These parts printed smoothly and snapping off the part was really satisfying.

            <p>
              There was no gluestick when I started printing my cover so it didn't stick to the bottom and one of the corners lifted during printing.
              Also, the cover printed as hollow and with no top. I'm a little confused, but I will ask Joshua in class what happened.
            </p>

            <p>
              My box failed because it was also hollow.
              After consulting Joshua, I learned that the spiralize outer counter setting is vase mode and selecting that would print only outlines.
              He also gave me advice that if there is no gluestick then having a squeaky clean bed of the printer should work fine.
              I also learned that you can detach the bed and wash it in the sink yay!
            </p>

            <p>
              I reprinted the box and its didn't come out the way I wanted, but I decided not to reprint because it took 8 hours.
              The lid fit on the side nicely and the connectors worked too.
            </p>

            <p>
              I did really like the color and texture of the side of the box, but the bottom didn't connect properly to the sides.
              Joshua explained that it might be because of multiple reasons like the heat wasn't consistent, etc.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/box/boxSideConnector.jpg" width=400>
            <p>
              The slot that I had made in the side of the box wasnt big enough for the lid and I think it was because I need to play with tolerancing.
              Next box I will do something I can cut faster to experiment with tolerancing faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I wasn't super satified with my box and would have tried something smaller and less ambitious if I had to do it over again.
