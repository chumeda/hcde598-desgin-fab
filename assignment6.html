              For this project we had to make a 3d shape using a milling machine.
              I decided I wanted to try remaking my box that I failed to make last week.
              First I drew sketched and extruded the shape in OnShape.

              I had a few dilemnas because I wanted to try to make part of it half milled out in order for the sliding to work properly.
              I tried drawing lines in kicad and experimenting with changing the offset.
              It was not successful so decided not to focus on that part in order to focus on the actual box.

              After going through a couple iterations I found the right fit for the box pieces to fit.
              This is the front of the box after assembly.

              I was happily surprised that the lid actually swiveled and opened.

              After looking at my box I think I will try to perfect the spacing so it's a more satifying fit.
              I also want to make the box bigger because I feel like that will allow me to fit it better.
              Lastly I want to make it a fully functional lid that actually slides into my box.
