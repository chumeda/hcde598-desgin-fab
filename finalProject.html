            <strong>Inspiration</strong><br>

            <p>

              The goal of my final project is to make a tiered tea tray with some chocolates.
              I looked for some inspiration on pinterest for simple tiered kits.
              I want my tiers to swivel so I looked up more inspiration on thingiverse and came across
              <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1211594/files">this rotating organizer</a>.
              I plan to copy the connecting mechanism to achieve the same spin.

                  from previous assignment)

                <li>Chocolate</li>

            </p>
            <strong>Rhino</strong><br>
            <p>
              The following are commands that I learned to create my model:<br>
              <i>handlecurve</i> - similar to drawing in illustrator <br>
              <i>editpton</i> - editing points <br>
              <i>pipe</i> - to give curves a thickness <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;boolean difference and union are opposite for pipes <br>
              <i>project</i> - to project a curve onto a surface in order to match contour
              (how I did the honey pot letters) <br>
            </p>
            <img src="pics/finalProj/rhinoTiers.png" width=400>
            <p>
              First I drew the tiers in Rhino.
            </p>
            <img src="pics/finalProj/rhinoMolds.png" width=400>
            <p>
              Then I drew the molds in Rhino using the handlecurve commands to draw similar to illustrator.
              I also learned project and thats how I got the letters of the honey pot to sit on the surface of the pot.
              I drew the letters then projected them to the pot and then used pipe to add thickness to the letters.
            </p>
            <strong>3D Printing</strong><br>
            <p>
              I had some trouble 3D printing because when I first started I originally wanted to print at Fluke.
              The first time I went to print I wasn't sure which printer to use and they had me on the FlashForge printer.
              When I came back my print had failed :(.
              The second time I went every single printer was being used so I had to leave.
              I finally decided on Saturday that I needed to start and went to the Mill.
              Our class filament was being used and the mill had run out of filament to buy.
              When I started asing around Andy was nice enough to let me do my tier parts with his filament.
              I also talked to Nitya who let me buy the rest of her spool from her to print my molds :).
            </p>

            <img src="pics/finalProj/3dmolds.jpg" width=400>
            <p>
              I printed my tiers connectors and base successfully.
              They fit together ok but there is a little wiggle room in the connectors that makes my tiers a little wobbly.
              Also, for the base I forget I accidentally made the connector part too tall and so the other connector sits higher than I would like.
            </p>
            <strong>Laser Cutting</strong><br>
            <img src="pics/finalProj/rhinoHoles.png" width=400>
            <p>
              In order to get a really snug fit I did some hole testing by cutting out different sized holes in my acrylic and testing it with my connector.
              14.8 mm was the magic number to get a good fit.
              I exported as an illustrator file and cut out my acrylic without any problems.
              Per Omari's advice, I used the following setting for the laser cutter: <br>
              100 power, 100 frequency, 8 speed
            </p>
            <strong>Casting and Molding</strong><br>
            <p>
              I used this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L3ZBHG6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">food safe silicone</a>
              that I bought for our previous <a href="assignment7.html">casting and molding assignment</a>.
              Part A to B mix is 10 to 1. It cures for 24 hours and then you bake it at 212 degrees fahrenheit for 4 hours.
              I ended up not using the bee mold because it was very difficult to get out of the 3d print and I ended up damaging the mold while I was taking it out.
              The other molds came out fine and I also used my smaller molds from my previous assignment for the chocolate.
            </p>
