            <h1>Final Project Proposal!</h1>

            <p>
              The goal of my final project is to make a tiered tea tray with some chocolates.
              I want my tiers to swivel so I looked up some inspiration on thingiverse and came across
              <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1211594/files">this rotating organizer</a>.
              I plan to copy the connecting mechanism to achieve the same spin.

            <p>
              Here are my rough plans drawn up in Rhino.

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Bill of Materials</strong><br>
              <ul>
                <li>3D printing filament - sourced from Fluke</li>
                <li>Silicone Mold (already have
                  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L3ZBHG6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">food safe silicone</a>
                  from previous assignment)
                </li>
                <li>Chocolate</li>
                <li>Acrylic for the tier trays - sourced from Fluke or Mill</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Contingency plans</strong><br>
              I am worried that 3D printing will fail for me and if that happens I will try to mill using the wax for my chocolates.
              I'm also worried about acrylic because I've never used it before.
              If acrylic doesn't work out for me I will most likely use cardboard.
              Time is another constraint.
              I scheduled everything to be done by Monday but realistically may need Tuesday to complete everything.
